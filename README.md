**RECOMMENDATION FOR SKIN CARE COSMETICS **

The project compares three different recommender systems: User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBC), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), and Cosine Similarity-based recommenders. Precision@K, Recall@K, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K), Hit Rate@K, Coverage@K, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@K) are used to assess each model's performance on a dataset containing product information and customer reviews. Based on comprehensive analysis and weighted scoring, the project seeks to identify the most effective model for personalized product recommendations. The findings reveal the strengths and limitations of each approach, allowing for more informed decisions in recommendation system design.
